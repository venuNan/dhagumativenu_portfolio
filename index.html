            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Dhagumati Venu. I was born and brought up in Manubolupadu, Dagadarthi Mandal, SPSR Nellore District. I live in a nuclear family. My father's name is Dhagumati Krishna Reddy, and he is a farmer. My mother's name is Dhagumati Madhavi, and she is a housewife.

            <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
            <p>
                I'm starting out as a Python developer, focusing on building apps that work smoothly and can grow as needed. I enjoy building backend apis and fullstack web apps , making sure everything runs well behind the scenes, and learning how to make apps that people find easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                While I'm mainly learning about Python for the technical part, I'm also curious about how websites and apps look and feel to users. I'm eager to work with others who know more about design to create apps that are useful and look good.

            <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I love technology and always want to know what's new and how it can help make things better. I like tackling problems and working with a team to find the best solutions. Outside of coding, I'm always trying to learn new programming skills and keep up with what's happening in the tech world.
